Beaconaor - an iBeacon location app
======================

This is an iBeacon app I submitted to WWDC scholarship compeition for 2016. 

The Beaconator App is used to track locations of users via BLE iBeacons. Since there was no practical way to display the true functionalities of the app, I have implemented test data and attached screenshots to show the code. When around iBeacons, CoreBluetooth begins monitoring for beacons and picks up the closest beacon and sends you a push notification that you have entered the region. It then sends that to the web-app, and the view pulls all the user's data from the web-app. If you have any more questions feel free to refer to the functionalities essay for more details.
